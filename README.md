****************************************


AstroPig Mission is an 2D action game where you have to collect items and solve puzzles!

With a mission to save his population from sustainability crises, Astropig on a mission to search the space and find resources that can help his home planet. Landing on a strange planet, he finds crystals that can emit clean energy, but the locals are not happy with an unfamiliar being exploring their home. Now, Astropig have to collect the crystals, avoid enemies and solve puzzles on his journey!

Inspired by various web games, we began working on AstroPig Mission trying to capture this same feeling of joy that you occasionally felt when you find an obscure and fun game while searching in old flash-games websites.
